         <!-- p staat voor paragraph, hiermee kan je dus paragrafen maken, hieronder een voorbeeld -->       
            <h3>p(paragraph)</h3>
             <p>
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s.
             </p>


        <!-- met 'br' kan je woorden in html forceren een nieuwe regel te beginnen-->           
            <h3>br(break)</h3>
             <p>
                when an unknown printer <br>
                took a galley of type <br>
                and scrambled it <br>
                to make a type specimen <br>
                book.

            The p element is used to represent a paragraph of text on a web page. <br>
            Screen readers announce the p element as a paragraph. This is important. 
            It allows the user to hear a few words of the paragraph and then skip to another one. <br>
            Breaking up content into paragraphs helps make a page more accessible. <br>
            For now, we recommend that you wrap every piece of text with a p element. 
            This recommendation will change slightly throughout the course as we learn about more semantic elements. <br>
            A paragraph does not necessarily need to have more than one sentence. <br>
            You will notice that a paragraph always starts on a new line. Also, 
            browsers will automatically add some space that acts as a separation before and after the paragraph. <br>
            Multiple paragraphs should be wrapped with multiple paragraph elements. <br>
            The br element should not be used to separate paragraphs or two elements. Instead, 
            it should only be used to create a new line within the same sentence or context. <br>
            A paragraph element will mostly contain text. For now, 
            it's important to know that you cannot nest a paragraph inside another one. <br>
            While you don't technically need to wrap text with a p element, we recommend that you do. 
            This helps you write semantic and accessible code. </li>
